        <a class="post-title" href="blog-post.html"> There is a new theory on why zebras have black and white
          stripes</a>
        <p class="post-text">Why do zebras have their unique black and white stripes?

          It’s a question many scientists have been asking ever since British naturalist Charles Darwin laid out his
          views on evolution in the mid-19th century.

          And one of the most compelling arguments was that their stripes may have an evolutionary purpose that keeps
          the animals cool in the hot weather.

          But now, a group of researchers in Sweden say they have debunked this theory, saying that temperature has
          nothing to do with the existence of stripes.

          They believe that the zebra’s black and white fur works as an “optical protection” against insects – such as
          blood-sucking horseflies.</p>

        <a class="post-title" href="blog-post.html"> Can the Northern White Rhino Be Brought Back From the Brink of
          Extinction?</a>
        <p class="post-text">When Sudan, the world’s last male northern white rhino, died in March at a wildlife
          preserve in Kenya, it seemed to signal the end of his kind. But it might not be over yet. Scientists on four
          continents are working with rhino eggs, cell cultures, tissues, blood and frozen sperm samples to produce a
          live northern white rhino birth—and maybe even repopulate the entire subspecies. If they succeed, it will be
          the first time a virtually extinct mammal with no living males has been brought back from the brink.

          One strategy depends on the subspecies’ two known females: Sudan’s 29-year-old daughter and 18-year-old
          granddaughter. Because neither is healthy enough to deliver a calf, scientists hope to extract some of their
          eggs, combine each egg with previously collected frozen sperm and implant the resulting embryo in another
          female.</p>
