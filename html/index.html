        <a class="post-title" href="blog-post-zebra.html"> There is a new theory on why zebras have black and white
        stripes</a>
        <p class="post-text">
          Why do zebras have their unique black and white stripes?
          It’s a question many scientists have been asking ever since British naturalist 
          Charles Darwin laid out his views on evolution in the mid-19th century.
          And one of the most compelling arguments was that their stripes may have an evolutionary purpose that keeps the animals cool in the hot weather.But now, a group of researchers in Sweden say they have debunked this theory, saying that temperature has nothing to do with the existence of stripes.
          They believe that the zebra’s black and white fur works as an “optical protection” against insects – such as blood-sucking horseflies.

            "This is the silliest thing I've done in my life," Ann says as she emerges from her tent.
            "I should have done it when I was much younger."
            "Tomorrow you'll think it was worth the effort," Maria responds.
            It's a bitterly cold night in January.
            I'm at Barafu Camp on Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania, with Ann Austen, a 69-year-old New Yorker and Maria Nielson, 55, from Sweden.
            In the midnight darkness I watch them join a line of 200 headlamps, slowly ascending the last slope to reach the highest point in Africa -- 5,895 meters (19,340 feet) above sea level. (Kilimanjaro's official elevation is the subject of dispute -- the preceding figures are the most commonly cited.)
            But I'm waiting.
            I'd learned from a local that while most groups trek to the summit overnight, hundreds at a time, to catch the sunrise from the top, the best time to climb is around 10 a.m. when the crowds, and the clouds, clear.
            "I know the mountain, this is my mountain," Sifael Malle tells me.
            It's a good decision.
            We're alone on Uhuru Peak, the highest point on Kibo crater, one of the three volcanic cones that comprise the mountain.
            Three champagne corks are the only sign that others had been here earlier.
            Without Malle's local knowledge, however, it could have been different.

        </a>
        <p class="post-text">When Sudan, the world’s last male northern white rhino, died in March at a wildlife
          preserve in Kenya, it seemed to signal the end of his kind. But it might not be over yet. Scientists on four continents are working with rhino eggs, cell cultures, tissues, blood and frozen sperm samples to produce a live northern white rhino birth—and maybe even repopulate the entire subspecies. If they succeed, it will be the first time a virtually extinct mammal with no living males has been brought back from the brink. One strategy depends on the subspecies’ two known females: Sudan’s 29-year-old daughter and 18-year-old granddaughter. Because neither is healthy enough to deliver a calf, scientists hope to extract some of their eggs, combine each egg with previously collected frozen sperm and implant the resulting embryo in another
          female.

        </a>
        <p class="post-text">The Serengeti migration or the wildebeest migration is hosted in Serengeti Eco system. Not only it is among wonders of Africa but also one of the ten natural travel wonders of the world. Serengeti migration involves millions of wildebeest, zebras, and gazelle as migrants while followed by animal of preys.
          Actually, wildebeest migration is an annual clockwise movement which moves continuously rounding Serengeti Eco system. Indeed Safaris in Tanzania will gives you a chance to see wildebeest migration in full. You may enjoy the wildebeest migration while on lodge safaris or temporary tented camp safaris.
          This wonders of Africa moves slowly from southern zone to the Northern corridor. Then, the migration enters Masai Mara in Kenya. Afterward, wildebeests go back to Tanzania from Masai mara. At this very point is where migrants need to cross river Mara.
          
          Masai mara river crossing is a moment of life and death where hundreds of wildebeests die in the process. It is when you realize the migration and Tanzanias safaris is a unique destination. You will all swear Serengeti should not die and that Tanzania safari is the best destination of all.
          
          Moreover, wildebeests that will manage to cross the Mara river which is full of crocodiles will continue to move. They will move across the eastern zone and back to the south of Ngorongoro and Serengeti for breeding season. Importantly Serengeti wildebeest migration is an endless process which makes Tanzanias Safari one of the wonders of the world.

          and getting sicker
        </a>
        <p class="post-text">
          Though slightly longer, the White Nile, which originates in East Africa's Lake Victoria and merges with the Ethiopian branch at Khartoum, carries a fraction of the volume.

          But these rains are not falling as they used to. And that is potentially catastrophic for the entire basin.
          
          The Meher, the long summer wet season, is arriving late, and the shorter rains earlier in the year sometimes not at all.
          
          “It’s so inconsistent now. Sometimes stronger, sometimes lighter, but always different,” said Lakemariam Yohannes Worku, a lecturer and climate researcher at Arba Minch University.
          
          When it does rain, the storms are often fiercer, washing over a billion tons of Ethiopian sediment into the Nile each year, which clogs dams and deprives farmers of much-needed soil nutrients.
          
          Population growth has fuelled this phenomenon, as expanding families fell trees to free up more space and provide construction materials. Monster floods have also become much more common.
          
          As crops wither and food prices soar, many rural communities, who have historically relied on steady rains rather than rivers to irrigate their land, have been pitched even deeper into desperate poverty.

        </a>
        <p class="post-text">
          The Sahara is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean on the west, the Red Sea on the east, the Mediterranean Sea on the north and the Sahel Savannah on the south. The enormous desert spans 11 countries: Algeria, Chad, Egypt, Libya, Mali, Mauritania, Morocco, Niger, Western Sahara, Sudan and Tunisia.
          The Sahara desert has a variety of land features, but is most famous for the sand dune fields that are often depicted in movies. The dunes can reach almost 600 feet (183 meters) high but they cover only about 15 percent of the entire desert. Other topographical features include mountains, plateaus, sand- and gravel-covered plains, salt flats, basins and depressions. Mount Koussi, an extinct volcano in Chad, is the highest point in the Sahara at 11,204 feet (3,415 m), and the Qattara Depression in Egypt is the Saraha's deepest point, at 436 feet (133 m) below sea level.
